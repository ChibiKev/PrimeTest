## Prime Test
Project for CSC 103 - Intro To Computing with Professor William Skeith at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
This project asks to implement a simple primality test. Recall that a number n > 1 is prime if the only divisors of n are 1 and itself (we don’t consider 1 to be prime).

Here’s what you can expect to learn from this:
- Looping and conditional constructs.
- How to make programs that play well with others (cf. the unix philosophy).
- A little bit about some nifty unix tools like awk and bash.
## Additional Information
- There are comments in the code that illustrates the thought process and exactly what each line of code is doing.
## Ask me about anything
